# myregexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of myregexcite is to make working with regular expressions in R more convenient and user-friendly. It provides helper functions that simplify common string manipulation tasks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of myregexcite like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("izzhou/myregexcite")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(myregexcite)
# Example string with comma-separated values
text <- "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta"

# Traditional approach with base R
strsplit(text, split = ",")

# Our simplified function returns a character vector directly
str_split_one(text, pattern = ",")

# It also handles various pattern types and options
# Split on first comma only
str_split_one("a,b,c", pattern = ",", n = 2)

# Split by period using fixed matching
str_split_one("192.168.0.1", pattern = stringr::fixed("."))
```

The str_split_one() function is particularly useful when you know your input is a single string and you want the result as a character vector rather than a list.

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
